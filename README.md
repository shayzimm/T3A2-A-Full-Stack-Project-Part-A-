## R4: User Stories

User stories are essential to understanding the features from the end user's perspective. Each story focuses on a specific feature or requirement of the app.

### Sample User Stories

- **As a user, I want to register and log in to the application so that I can access personalized features.**
- **As a user, I want to view available tiny homes so that I can decide which one to book.**
- **As an admin, I want to manage property listings so that I can update, add, or delete properties.**

*The full list of user stories with detailed acceptance criteria can be included here.*

## R5: Wireframes

Wireframes provide a visual representation of the app's layout for various screen sizes. These wireframes guide the design and development of the user interface.

### Wireframes

## Conclusion

Part A of the Tiny Home Accommodation Booking App outlines the foundational aspects of the project, including the purpose, functionality, and design. The dataflow and architecture diagrams, along with the wireframes and user stories, provide a comprehensive overview of the app's structure and intended user experience.

We look forward to building upon this foundation in Part B, where we will implement the app's functionality and deploy it to a live environment.
