# T3A2-A: Full Stack App (Part A)

## R1. Project Overview

### Purpose

The Yallambee Tiny Homes Accommodation Booking App is designed to provide a seamless platform for users to browse and book stays in a unique tiny home. While Yallambee is currently available through Airbnb, this app will offer greater control over bookings, allowing the client to provide a more personalised and direct experience for their guests. The app empowers guests to explore the Yallambee property, check availability, make bookings, and manage their reservations effortlessly, all in one place.

For admin users, the platform offers robust tools to manage property listings, oversee bookings, and maintain user profiles, ensuring that the operations of Yallambee Tiny Homes are handled smoothly and efficiently. By transitioning to their own booking system, the client aims to enhance the guest experience and streamline their business operations, providing a tailored service that aligns with the unique and tranquil nature of Yallambee.

### Functionality / Features

#### MVP

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Property Listing/s**: Users can view available properties (one, initially), including details such as price, location, and amenities.
- **Booking System**: Users can make a reservation by selecting available dates and processing payments (payments are a stretch goal).
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can add, update, and delete property listings, manage bookings, and oversee user accounts.

#### Stretch

- **Payment Integration**: Users can securely process payments for their reservations through a third-party payment gateway.
- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Users can leave reviews and rate their stay after completing a booking. Admins will have the ability to moderate reviews to ensure appropriate content is displayed.
- **Notifications**: Users will receive email or SMS notifications for booking confirmations, payment receipts, and reminders. Admins will also receive notifications for new bookings and cancellations, ensuring they are always up-to-date with the latest activities on the platform.

### Target Audience

The target audience for Yallambee Tiny Homes primarily includes young, professional couples from Sydney and Canberra who are seeking a unique and tranquil getaway. These travelers are looking for a chance to disconnect from their busy lives and enjoy a peaceful stay in a beautiful, off-grid tiny home. Additionally, the app is designed to cater to the owners of Yallambee, who wish to efficiently manage bookings, listings, and guest interactions through a more controlled and personalised platform.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Passport.js, JWT
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe API
- **Notifications**: Nodemailer (Email), Twilio (SMS)

*Include a brief explanation of how the Trello board was used to manage the project timeline and task assignments.*

### Project Timeline

As a team, we created a prospective [timeline](project_management/project_timeline.md) to help us stay on track with our tasks and better manage the project.

### Ways of Working

We developed a Ways of Working document to enhance communication, collaboration, and efficiency within our team. We wanted to establish that everyone is aligned and working towards the same goals, with clear processes in place to support successful project completion. Please see [here](project_management/WaysOfWorking.md).

### GitHub Workflow

We have outlined our GitHub workflow and branching stategy [here](.github/step-by-step-github-workflow.md).

### Client Feedback

We collated feedback and ideas from our client [here](project_management/client_feedback.md). This document will be used throughout the project and iterated with client feedback as the project progresses.

### API Specifications

Our draft API specs can be found [here](project_management/API_specs.md).
