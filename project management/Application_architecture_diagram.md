# Application Architecture Diagram (AAD)

## Overview

Application Architecture Diagram outlines the high-level structure of Full Stack web application. It illustrates the major components, their interactions, and the technologies used. This application uses the MERN stack, including MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, and Node.js.

## Components

### Front-End: ReactJS

- **Components:**
  - **Homepage:** General information and navigation.
  - **Property Listings:** Display of available properties and details.
  - **Booking Page:** View availability and make reservations.
  - **User Profile:** Manage user information and preferences.
  - **Admin Dashboard:** Manage properties, bookings, and reviews.

- **State Management:**
  - **React Hooks:** `useState`, `useEffect`.
  - **Optional:** Redux for complex state management.

- **UI Design:**
  - **CSS:** 

- **Integration:**
  - Connects to backend APIs for authentication, bookings, and reviews.

### Back-End: Node.js with Express.js

- **API Layer:**
  - **Routes:**
    - **User Authentication:** Registration, login, profile management using JWT.
    - **Property Management:** Adding, updating, and deleting property listings.
    - **Booking Management:** Checking availability and making reservations.
    - **Admin Dashboard:** Managing and updating listings, bookings, and reviews.

- **Business Logic:**
  - Handles authentication, booking logic, and administrative tasks.

### Database: MongoDB

- **Collections:**
  - **Users:** User profiles and authentication details.
  - **Listings:** Property information (descriptions, images, availability).
  - **Bookings:** Reservation details (user information, dates).
  - **Reviews:** User reviews and ratings.

### External Services

- **Payment Gateway (Future Feature):**
  - **Options:** ShopPay, PayPal.

- **Notification Services (Future Feature):**
  - **Options:**
    - **Email:** Nodemailer.
    - **SMS:** Twilio.

## Diagram Overview

- **Front-End:**
  - ReactJS components interact with the backend API layer for user actions.

- **Back-End:**
  - The Express.js API layer processes requests, handles business logic, and communicates with MongoDB.

- **Database:**
  - MongoDB stores and retrieves data as needed.

- **External Services:**
  - Integrates with the backend for payment processing and notifications.

## Supporting Documentation

### Technical Specifications

- **ReactJS:** Front-end library for building UIs.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side code.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for data storage.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Token for secure authentication.
- **Payment Gateways:** ShopPay, PayPal (for future integration).
- **Notification Services:** Nodemailer, Twilio (for future integration of email and SMS).

### Implementation Notes

- Follow security best practices for authentication and data handling.
- Optimize state management and API interactions for performance.
- Plan for scalability in both database design and application architecture.

### Integration Points

- **Front-End:** Makes API calls to the Express.js backend for data operations.
- **Back-End:** Manages business logic and interacts with MongoDB.
- **External Services:** Handles payments and notifications integrated into the backend.
